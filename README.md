# Customer Segmentation with RFM Analysis
In the ever-evolving landscape of business, understanding and effectively catering to the unique needs of customers is paramount. Customer segmentation, the practice of dividing a customer base into groups with similar traits, allows businesses to tailor their strategies for enhanced customer engagement and satisfaction. This project delves into the realm of customer segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysisâ€”a powerful method that classifies customers based on their recent purchase behavior, frequency of transactions, and monetary value. </br>

## Objectives
This project is mainly aiming for two goals: </br>
* The first goal is to calculate RFM scores for each customers based on their historical purchasing data. The purpose is to analyze customer value and explore the metrics to build the clustering algorithm.
* The second goal is to segment customers into a number of cluster for the strategy development.
## Dataset Description
I used an [E-Commerce Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data) from Kaggle that contains transaction information from around 4,000 customers. </br>
